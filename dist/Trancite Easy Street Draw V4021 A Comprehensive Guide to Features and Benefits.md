## Expansive Symbol Library
 
One of the advantages of Trancite Easy Street Draw V4021 is that it comes with more than 800 drag-and-drop symbols that you can use to create your diagrams. These symbols include vehicles, roads, intersections, traffic signs, pedestrians, animals, debris, skid marks, and more. You can also customize the symbols by changing their size, color, orientation, and position. The symbols are intelligent and know how to correctly interact with one another. For example, if you drag a vehicle onto a road, it will automatically snap to the lane and direction of the road. If you drag a traffic sign onto an intersection, it will automatically align with the appropriate street.
 
## Save Time
 
Another benefit of Trancite Easy Street Draw V4021 is that it can help you save time when creating your diagrams. You can diagram faster than pen and paper by using the intuitive interface and the drag-and-drop functionality. You can also use templates and pre-drawn scenes to quickly start your diagram. You can also integrate your diagrams with records management solutions (RMS) such as TraCS, eCrash, eCitation, etc. This way, you can easily import and export data between your diagrams and your RMS reports. You can also print or export your diagrams as PDF, JPG, PNG, or SVG files.
